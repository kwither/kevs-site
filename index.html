            <h4>A Brief History</h4>
                <p>Whether you are a fan of seafood, or prefer meat from the land, or even vegetables and more nature foods, you've heard of one of the most well known, popular asian dishes around. Sushi! Sushi nowadays comes in various prep styles, and contain a plethora of combinations made to suit the taste buds of many. If you love seafood, sushi is offered raw or cooked, and with many different kinds of seafood, from salmon to shrimp, with toppings anywhere from roe to fruit slices, and many other seafoods to satisfy seafood lovers. If you prefer land meat you can find chicken, pork, and many steak sushi's. Of course if you prefer a more vegetarian style food, sushi has that too! Over the past decades, sushi has rapidly become a popular international dish all around the world. So far in 2022, there are <a href="https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/sushi-restaurants-united-states/#:~:text=How%20many%20businesses%20are%20there,increase%20of%203.6%25%20from%202021." target="_blank">15,999 sushi restaurant</a> and increasing!
                <br><br> Sushi originated in China, contrary to popular belief that it was created in Japan, it started in from the rice fields of China and was called narezushi in those times. Japan played a huge role in introducing sushi to many travelers and also introducing a variety. Way back before refrigerators existed, narezushi was still eaten fresh by fermenting the rice and heavily salting the fish to prevent bacteria and allowing for longer freshness without the use of refrigeration. Back then instead of eating the rice, as we do now with the rice, it was normally thrown out and then the fish was eaten. The rice served more as a wrap to preserve the fish. Around the 8th century, narezushi spread from China to Japan, where the name was eventually referred to as sushi. Even until late 18th century, sushi, though developing in the prepping process, the fish was typically cooked due to lack of refrigeration. A chef by the name of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-sushi-was-invented-1683686290" target="_blank">Hanaya Yohei</a> was essentially the first person that introduces sushi as we all popularly know it today. 
                <br><br> The process of making rice and adding some vinegar, along a small piece of raw fish that was placed on top, was first introduced by Hanaya Yohei. This style became known as the nigiri, which did originate from Japan, and is now the popular, well known all around the world, style of sushi. From there, various other styles of sushi preparations came about, along with the many ingredients used to try and satisfy the taste buds of the majority of people all over.</p>

            <p class="nigiri">Directions</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In a pot add 1 cup of short grain sushi rice and 1 cup of water. Bring water to boil on medium high heat, <strong>do not stir rice</strong>, then bring heat down to a low medium until all water is gone. Then bring heat to low and let sit for 5 mins.</li>
                <li>Once rice is done, fluff with a fork, then add in seasoning (sushi vinegar, or in the case you don't have sushi vinegar, mix in some white vinegar, salt, and white sugar to taste. Set seasoned rice aside for a few minutes to cool down.</li>
                <li>Grab your sushi grade salmon and cutting against the grain, cut pieces of approximately 3 inches long, 1 inch wide, and 1/4 inch thickness.</li>
                <li>Get your hands slightly wet and grab about 3 Tbsp of rice and pace in your hand, squeeze the rice until you form an oval shape. Put these oval shaped rice balls aside for now.</li>
                <li>Grap 1 cut piece of the raw salmon and place on your palm, then grab 1 oval shaped rice ball and place it ontop of the raw salmon piece in your hand. You should see an upside down nigiri at this point. Press down on the rice with your fingers to flatten slightly so you are able to turn it over and place it on a plate.</li>
            </ol>
